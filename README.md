# ML MiniHack (DataHulk)
My solution to 6 Hrs Mini Machine Learning Hack.
I #Ranked 18 in the competition with ( 0.681 ) score.</br></br>
<b> Aim : </b> The aim of this competition was to predict the price of given stock will move up or down on the next day. </br>
<b>Metric Used : </b>Logloss</br>
<b>My Methodology : </b> Simple 4 step solution </br>
1. EDA
2. Impute missing values if any
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Development and CV

<b>Solution Info : </b> Data Quality was excellent and most of the variables which are important for predicting stock prices like volume , moving averages of various past days were alredy given. I decided to make simple gbm model with one feature engineering and considering data of only last 365 days. I wanted to optimize more by developing a neural network but due to short timespan couldn't. I finally end up with 18th rank on private leaderboard.
